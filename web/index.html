        <h1><b>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</b></h1>
        <div><p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite 
            holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite 
            Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
            <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite 
            Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, 
            I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
